This project is based on the Digital Image Processing course design and covers practical tasks from basic to advanced image processing and analysis. Implemented in MATLAB without relying on built-in system functions, the project focuses on low-level algorithm implementation and interactive experience, making it ideal for learning and studying the core principles of image processing.

✅ Functional Modules

Basic Image Operations: Image reading, saving, and grayscale quantization (16, 64, 128 levels).

Spatial Domain Image Enhancement: Point operations, arithmetic operations, histogram equalization, smoothing and sharpening filters.

Color Image Processing: Multiple color space conversions, complementary color processing, grayscale transformation.

Fourier Transform: Implementation of DFT/FFT and their inverse transforms.

Frequency Domain Image Enhancement: Frequency domain smoothing and sharpening filters.

Image Restoration: Adding various types of noise and restoring images using spatial and frequency domain filters.

Image Compression: Lossless compression using Huffman, Arithmetic, and LZW coding, and lossy compression using DCT, DFT, and WHT.

Morphological Processing: Dilation, erosion, opening and closing operations, boundary extraction, and region filling.

Image Segmentation: Based on intensity discontinuity, thresholding, region growing, and edge detection operators.

Representation and Description: Multiple image representation methods and boundary and relational descriptors.

Image Retrieval: Feature extraction and similarity matching.

Integrated System: Combines functions from Chapters 1–11 into a unified interactive system.
